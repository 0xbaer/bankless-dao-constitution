**Scope**: Minor Change

## BDIP SUMMARY

Based on the feedback received from the Swapping BanklessDAO Multi-Signers [Temp Check] 8 , this bDIP seeks to modify the BanklessDAO Constitution to include text regarding the selection criteria, mandate, and election procedures associated with the role of a BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signer.
BDIP BACKGROUND

    In S1, BanklessDAO members agreed to transfer control 2 of the DAO treasury from the Genesis members to the DAO. The results were then ratified via Snapshot 2.
    Via Forum 1 post, DAO members applied to become BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers. An election was held on the Forum, and later ratified via Snapshot 1.
    The current cohort of BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers are: Icedcool, frogmonkee, Above Average Joe, RedVan, 0xLucas, Eagle, and Kouros. Only Above Average Joe and Icedcool remain active in the DAO.
    The recent Temp Check 8 indicated a desire to codify the mandate, selection, and election of BanklessDAO‚Äôs multi-signature wallet signers.
    This bDIP seeks to enshrine the mandate, selection criteria, and election procedures for BanklessDAO‚Äôs multi-signatue wallet signers in the Constitution.

## BDIP SPECIFICATION

|Current Form| Proposal|
|-----|----- | 
|Current Form of ‚ÄúDAO Organizational Units‚Äù.  There is no mention of the BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers in the Constitution|Text to be included immediately before the Grants Committee section of DAO Organizational Units]



BanklessDAO Vault Multi-Signature Wallet

The BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet (vault multisig) receives BANK on a seasonal basis from the BANK token contract, and disburses BANK to DAO Organizational Units. It is managed by a team of seven BanklessDAO members, and requires four of the seven members to sign in order for any transaction to be executed.

Vault multisig signers have the following rights and responsibilities:

Vault Multisig Signer Elections

To be considered for selection and to retain the role, vault multisig signers must meet the following criteria:

- To be considered for selection and to retain the role, vault multisig signers must meet the following criteria:
- Recognition as a Level 2 Contributor of BanklessDAO.
    Active membership of BanklessDAO for at least one year.
- A previously held leadership position in the DAO (equivalent to Guild Coordinator, Project Champion, Grants Committee).
- Experience as a signer on a multi-signature wallet.
- Current knowledge of BanklessDAO‚Äôs governance procedures.


Elections have the following procedure:

    To kick off an election, any BanklessDAO member can post a formal proposal 4 to check the level of support to hold a vault multisig signer election. This proposal must have a poll which passes the Minor quorum thresholds 4.
    When the formal proposal reaches quorum, the member may then post a Forum post to gather candidates. In this post, candidates must provide evidence that they meet the eligibility requirements. This proposal must stay up for at least one week.
    After one week, the veracity of each candidate‚Äôs eligibility evidence must be validated by the member who posted the proposal. This member will then post the final candidate list in a comment on the proposal.
    The current vault multisig signers must then post a token-weighted poll on Snapshot with the list of candidates specified above as well as a list of the current vault multisig signers as options (barring any signer who wishes to step away from the role). This poll must stay open for at least one week.
    The seven candidates with the highest proportion of support will become the new vault multisig signers. The current signers must take the steps to add/remove members as needed to ensure the group of vault multisig signers reflects the will of the DAO.

## Removal of Vault Multisig Signers

Vault multisig signers can be removed if:

    a vault multisig signer has violated any of the mandated responsibilities.
    any member in the DAO gathers consensus via Forum on the no-confidence state of a vault multisig signer or the vault multisig signers as a whole.

There is no term limit for vault multisig signers, however continuation in the role is subject to the community vote.

## EXPECTED IMPACT

This change will mean the DAO has adequately documented procedural information about the role of a BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signer. It is anticipated that if enacted, this update will be followed with an election for a new team of BanklessDAO Vault multi-signature wallet signers.
##  ANALYTICS

After this bDIP is ratified, we hope to hold an election to increase active multi-signature wallet signers from 2/7 to 7/7.
