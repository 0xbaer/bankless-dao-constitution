Title: [bDIP-N]: GC purpose and Quorum.

Draft Authors: \[Baer.eth, links, Ornella, Icedcool.eth Paulito\]

Working Group: \[The Grants committee\]

# BDIP SUMMARY

TLDR;

* This bDIP changes the purpose of the Grants committee in enabling the disbursement of more assets other than the BANK token and Bankless Brand.
* The bDIP also changes the quorum to a simple majority.
* All the changes are proposed according to the sentiment check made by the Grants committee on the BankklessDAO forum.   

# BDIP BACKGROUND

What problem or opportunity does this proposal target? What are the driving factors behind why you think this is a good idea?

The BanklessDAO Grants Committee faces operational challenges, including an unclear mandate, member retention issues, and a contentious funding process. The committee is proposing reforms to clarify its objectives, optimize member engagement, and streamline the grant allocation mechanism to better serve the DAO's long-term mission according to the outcomes of the temp check.

The Challenges outlined in the temperature check.
* **Unclear Mandate**: The purpose of the GC is not clearly defined, and the GC cannot distribute resources other than the BANK token, leading to confusion and differing goals among members.
* Difficulty in Attracting and Retaining Members: The relatively complex structure of The GC is causing problems in attracting and retaining members and has struggled with achieving quorum, which is essential for its operation.
